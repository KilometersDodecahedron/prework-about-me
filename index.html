      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am excited to be furthering my education.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Montclair, NJ</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Playing videogame (skylanders especially) and working on my own game. 
        (I'm making it in Unity. That's how I was first introduced to coding.)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>At first I wanted to be a Game Dev, but now I'm interested in branching out to general app development.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In an apartment in Montclair, NJ. 
        It's technically a suburb, but we also have a nature preserve and a thriving business district.
        Saddly the local pedestrians seem to be under the delusion that they're indestructible.
        I'm telling ya, they're nuts!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been an avid gamer, and wanted to be a dev, so I taught myself the basics of the Unity engine.
        I really enjoyed the (somewhat limited) coding aspects, so now I want to make a career out of it.
